NAME
----
pwlist - Password List Generator


SYNOPSIS
--------
*pwlist* ['OPTIONS'] _FILES_...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool is designed to help create simple wordlists based on defined masks and
combinations with already existing wordlists. "Hashcat" is usually the preferred
utility for larger files and more complex masks, but this allows for just a
simple utility to create basic modifications that may not be possible with just
hashcat. This program is best used in conjunction with Hashcat and its
masks/rules, but if you need a quick modification made to a wordlist, this is
the tool.

OPTIONS
-------
*-format*='FORMATSTRING'::
	Identifies the format and masks to use in the output.

*-rtable*=['NTLM', 'MD5', 'SHA1', 'SHA256', 'SHA512']::
	Creates basic rainbow tables with common un-salted hashes. The hash is
	placed before the wordlist entry, and separated with a colon.

*-version*::
    Print the version and exit.

*-v*::
    Verbose logging.

FORMATSTRING
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The format string allows for any text to be entered that will be joined with
other masks and wordlist files. To enter masks/wordlist files, you may use
vertical bars to create specialized commands that then run and handle parsing.
These commands can have additional modifications attached to them, usually to
adjust the case of the line. For example, if I wanted to load the hexadecimal
charset, I could insert "|x|" somewhere in the format string, and it would
generate. If I wanted to ensure that the hexadecimal letters were capitalized,
I could do "|h-upper|". All masks by default are lowercase, if applicable. All
possible masks are explained below.

- |l| - Latin Alphabet. Supports "upper" modification.
- |d| - Arabic Numerals 0-9.
- |s| - Symbols. <space>!\"#$%^&*()`+-./:;<=>?@[]\\_{}~,|
- |x| - Hexadecimal 0-9 a-f. Supports "upper" modification.
- |a| - l, l-upper, d, and s.

When loading a wordlist, pass it as additional arguments after OPTIONS. To use
the files when formatting, use the position the file was loaded in, starting
with 0. For example, if I want to load the second file passed, and apply the
"upper" modification to it, I could do "|1-upper|". Modifications are available
for lowercase (-'lower'), uppercase (-'upper'), and title case (-'title').
